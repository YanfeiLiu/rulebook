* Click on “Issues” (https://github.com/iuf/rulebook/issues)

## Building the Rulebook

### Requirements

* A latex distribution supporting **pdflatex** with many common packages installed (for example **texlive** with **texlive-latex-extra** on debian based systems like Ubuntu). In addition, the following packages/scripts are required and can be found in the `dependencies` directory:
 * gitinfo
 * latexdiff (with latexdiff-so and latexdiff-vc)

### Building

Open a terminal in the repository root and type **make rulebook**. This will generate **pdf/iuf-rulebook-$BRANCHNAME.pdf**.

To include git revision information in the document, you need to install git hooks to extract the information from git.
Do this with **./install_hooks**. Build the document again and the information should appear.

To produce a PDF highlighting the changes, type **make diff**.
This will generate **pdf/iuf-rulebook-$OLDBRANCH-diff-$BRANCH.pdf**.
The current branch will be combpared with the branch(es) in the `diff-branches` file.

### Gitinfo package  
If the build is failing because the gitinfo2 package cannot be found, copy the `gitinfo2.sty` from `dependencies` into the `src` directory.
