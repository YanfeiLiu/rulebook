\chapter{Overview}

\section{Definition}

X-Style is an event for riders to show off their most difficult skills.
Riders can show their own style with creativity and ingenuity.
The competitors are judged solely on the skills that they complete.
Performance and falls do not count like in other freestyle competitions.

In X-Style, starting groups of ten or fewer riders compete against each other, and the top three riders advance to the next round.
Riders show off their best skills in an individual run that is between 1 and 2 minutes in length based on the round.
Judges will be selected from other starting groups or from non-competing volunteers.
