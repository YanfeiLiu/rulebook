\section{Definition}

The object of Speed Trials is for riders to traverse a pre-set course as quickly as possibly.
Riders are either timed or raced against each other.
Time is kept when the start of the race is called and when the riders cross the finish line.
The winner is the fastest rider to cross the finish line or make it the furthest along the course.
