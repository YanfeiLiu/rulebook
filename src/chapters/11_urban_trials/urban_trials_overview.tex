\chapter{Overview}

\begin{comment2016}
Much of the Trials rules consist of descriptions of various things, and are not rules, as such.
This whole chapter should be reworded to make rules!

\section{Definition}

\begin{comment2016}
The following text, which does not contain any rules, has more detail than the intro to other chapters.
It could be rewritten to pare it down.
It would be nice to add text saying the rider carries a score card which is signed by a judge at the completion of each section.

The object of unicycle trials is to ride over obstacles.
A unicycle trials competition takes place on a ``course'' containing different obstacles called ``sections''.
Each section is given a point value depending on difficulty. (Easy - 1 point, Medium - 3 points, and Hard - 7 points.)

A course typically contains anywhere from 20 to 80 or more sections and Riders earn points by successfully riding (``cleaning'') each section from start to finish.
The objective is to earn as many points as possible by cleaning as many sections as possible.

The competition takes place within a specified time period.
Sections may include narrow beams or logs, steep climbs, rocks, etc.

The average difficulty level of sections will vary between competitions depending on the ability level of the riders participating.

Section boundaries are defined by flagging tape and/or instructions that designate a start line, section boundaries, and a finish line.
