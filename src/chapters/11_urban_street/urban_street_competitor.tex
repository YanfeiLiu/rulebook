\chapter{Competitor Rules}

\section{Safety}

Riders must wear shoes and helmet.
Shin guards are recommended, but not mandatory.

\section{Unicycles}

Any number of regular unicycles (see definitions in chapter \ref{chap:general_definitions}) may be used.

\section{Rider Identification}

No rider identification is required.

\section{Protests}

Protests must be filed on an official form within 15 minutes of the posting of event results.
Protest is only possible against mistakes in calculation or other mistakes not connected to a judge's subjective score.
The Chief Judge must resolve all protests within 30 minutes of receipt of the written form.

There probably needs to be some text about how protests apply to the preliminary and final format of the competition.
The following rule also applies to protests, but may not be accurate.

\section{Results}
Preliminary results will be posted once the calculation of the points is done.
Results sheets will be posted after each category of an event.
The protest periods begins at this point.
Finals results may be held off until the award ceremony if it is on the same day.

\section{Event Flow}

\subsection{Riders Must Be Ready}
The Chief Judge chooses how to handle the riders who are not ready at their scheduled competition time.
They may be disqualified or allowed to perform after the last competitor in their category.

\section{Preliminaries}
Riders will be put into groups of three or four (preferably 4, but in some cases, there may need to be up to 3 groups of 3 depending on the number of competitors).
Each group will be given a starting time, and they will proceed to their starting zone.
They will be given 6 goes per rider in each zone to perform as many tricks as possible.
(Depending on the possible time window the host can decide to reduce or expand the number of allowed goes but 4 is be the minimum number.)
The riders are assigned an order and they may only attempt a trick when it is their turn.
The order should be presented in writing as well as announced before the competition.
Riders may choose to skip their turn in the event of an injury or any other reason.
The group will then move on to the next zone.

\section{Finals}
The top 5 or 6 riders will be chosen to participate in the finals, which should be a few hours later, or the next day.
Finals should preferably not be before noon, because we want a lot of spectators, and we want to riders to have a chance to warm up and be ready to be at their best.
In the finals, the same 3 zones will be used, and all riders will go at the same time for 12 to 15 minutes in each zone.
(Depending on the possible time window the host can decide to reduce the time but 10 minutes is the minimum.)
The riders are assigned an order and they may only attempt a trick when it is their turn.
The order should be presented in writing as well as announced before the competition.
Riders may choose to skip their turn in the event of an injury or any other reason.
There will be 5 judges in the finals, and these can be made up from some of the judges of prelims, or even riders that did not make it into the finals.
