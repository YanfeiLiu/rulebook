\section{Judges}

\subsection{Judging Panel}

There are three judges per section for the preliminary rounds, and five judges for the finals.

\subsection{Selecting Judges}
A person should not judge an event if he or she is:
\begin{itemize}
\item A parent, child or sibling of a rider competing in the event.
\item A coach, manager, trainer or colleague of the same club/team as a rider competing in the event.
\item More than one judge from the same country on the same judging panel.
\end{itemize}

If the judging pool is too limited by the above criteria, restrictions can be eliminated starting from the bottom of the list and working upward as necessary, but only until enough judges are available.

\subsection{Judging Panel May Not Change}

The individual members of the judging panel must remain the same for an entire category.
In the event of an emergency, this rule can be waived by the Chief Judge.

\subsubsection{Rating Judge Performance}
Judges are rated by comparing their scores to those of other judges at previous competitions.
If a judge's performance is determined to be too weak, they may be removed from the judging panel.

Characteristics of Judging Weaknesses:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Excessive Ties:}
Using ties frequently (it defeats the purpose of judging.)
\item \textbf{Bias:}
Placing members of certain groups or nations significantly lower or higher than other judges.
\item\textbf{Inconsistence:}
Ranking a large number of riders significantly different from the average of other judges.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training}
The judges workshop is set by the Street Director or Chief Judge.
Either the Street Director or the Chief Judge run the workshop.
The workshop must be help before the competition.
Judges should have read the rules prior to the start of the workshop.
The workshop will include a practice session.
Each judge will read the rules, attend the workshop, agree to follow the rules and agree to their potential removal from the list of available judges if they show excessive judges weaknesses, as determined by the Chief Judge.
