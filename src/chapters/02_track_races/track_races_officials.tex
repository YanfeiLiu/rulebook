\chapter{Judges and Officials Rules}

The Referee has final say on whether a rider's safety equipment is sufficient.
The Starter will remove from the starting line-up any riders not properly equipped to race, including riders with dangerously loose shoelaces.

All officials wording needs to be reviewed for consistency.
Some sections include wording about training, but others to no not.

The Track Director is the head organizer and administrator of track events.
The Track Director is responsible for the logistics and equipment for all track events.
With the Referee, the Track Director is in charge of keeping events running on schedule, and answers all questions not pertaining to rules and judging.
The Track Director is the highest authority on everything to do with the track events, except for decisions on rules and results.

The Referee is the head track official, whose primary job is to make sure the competitors follow the rules.
The Referee makes all final decisions regarding rule infractions.
The Referee is responsible for resolving protests.
The Referee makes sure other track officials are trained and ready.

The Starter starts races; explains race rules; calls riders back in the event of false starts.
Also checks riders for correct unicycles and safety equipment.

The Finish Line Judge determines whether rides cross the finish line properly, according to the rules.

\section{Training Officials}
As the rules state, competitions cannot be started until all key track officials have been trained and understand their tasks.
For Racing, the Referee is in charge of making sure this happens.

\section{Starter Responsibilities\label{sec:track_starter}}

Most Starter Responsibilities follow from the text in \ref{subsec:track-field_starting}, Starting and \ref{subsec:track-field_false-starts}, False Starts.

If a verbal (spoken) count is used, there should be about 3/4 second between each element in the count, with the same amount of time between each of them.
Starters should practice this before the races begin.
Timing of the count is very important for an accurate start.
This count can be in the local language, or a language agreed upon before competition starts.

\section{Finish Line Judge Responsibilities}

\subsection{Judging Finish Line Dismounts}
One or more officials are required at the finish line to judge dismounts in all races where dismounting is allowed.
These officials must be appointed by the racing referee so they fully understand their crucial job.
The finish line judges are the voice of authority on whether riders must remount and cross the finish line again.
Any riders affected must be clearly and immediately signaled to return to a spot before the finish line, remount without overlapping the finish line, then ride across it again.
The path for backing up may involve going around any finish line timing or optical equipment to prevent data problems for other riders in the race.

\subsection{Timing Penalty For Finish Line Dismounts}
When a rider dismounts while crossing the finish line and has to back up, remount and cross the finish properly, it may happen that the first (illegal) finish is timed, and that this prevents the timing system from recording the time of the actual (proper) finish.
(This may happen with a light beam finish timing system, or one based on chip timing.
It will usually not happen with a modern slit camera system.)

If possible, the proper finish time must be reconstructed or estimated from whatever data is available, such as legitimate finish times of other riders in relation to the rider in question, video, photographs, or a ``manual'' reading from a running time display.

If it is in no way possible to assess an actual finish time, the riderâ€™s time will be recorded as 0.01 seconds faster than the next rider to cross the line after their remount and crossing.
In this way, the heat finish order is preserved.
If the rider in question is the last one on the track, the time recorded should be the best possible estimate of their actual time crossing the finish line after their remount.
