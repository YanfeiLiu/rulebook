## Overview of Updates to the IUF Rulebook (2015 to 2017)
This document wishes to serve as a simple overview of the changes that were passed in the 2016 IUF Rulebook Committee. These are the changes between the 2015 IUF Rulebook and the 2017 IUF Rulebook (draft).

After publication of the 2017 rulebook, on the [IUF Publications webpage](https://unicycling.org/publications/) you will also be able to find a comprehensive, automatically generated PDF that contains all of the changes.

As always, as stated in *1B.3 Knowing The Rules*, you are obligated to know the updated IUF rules and reading this document does not serve as a replacement for reading the new rulebook. This document simply wishes to give a quick but thorough list of the differences.

Prior to changes made by the 2016 IUF Rulebook Committee, the whole rulebook has been reorganzied. In the reorganization process, no rules were changed. A [full write-up](https://unicycling.org/2016/10/07/iuf-rulebook-reorganization/) of the proccess and the new structure can be found on the IUF Blog. A very simple explanation of the reorganization processes is that each chapter is now split up into four subchapters:  
Overview  
Competitor Rules  
Judges and Officials Rules  
Event Organizer Rules  

Some organizational and administrative rule changes have been omitted from this document.

The changes below are listed by chapter in the reorganized rulebook.

## 1 General
#### Awards
Conditions have been added to ensure equitable awards between genders (male and female), classes (e.g. Standard and Unlimited), and events (e.g. Trials and Road Racing). The host must also make a "Personal Certificate" available to each competitor with a summary of their results.

#### Protests
The rules around allowable evidence for protests have been updated and clarified. Specifically, the rules about official and unofficial video sources has been changed. The Chief Referee can now choose to use private photos and videos as evidence in the case of a protest.

#### Wheel Size Classes Definition
A new system for describing wheel sizes for all IUF events has been created. This definition is used throughout the rulebook. The definitions of "Standard Unicycle" and "Unlimited Unicycle" have also been edited slightly for clarity and consistency with this definition. In addition, if an unlimited unicycle has multiple wheels, it must not be possible to ride the unicycle if more than one of the wheels are touching the ground.


| Unicycle Class  	| Max Diameter 	| Min Crank Length | Transmission |
|-----------------	|--------------	|------------------|--------------|
| 16  Class        	| 418mm        	| 89mm             | standard     |
| 20  Class        	| 518mm        	| 100mm            | standard     |
| 24  Class        	| 618mm        	| 125mm            | standard     |
| 24+ Class        	| 640mm        	| No limit         | standard     |
| 29  Class        	| 778mm        	| No limit         | standard     |
| Unlimited Class 	| No limit     	| No limit         | unlimited    |

#### Wheel Walking Definition
This definition has been clarified. Wheel walking can be always be done with one or both feet.

## 2 Track Racing
The new unicycle class definitions have been applied to this chapter. However no requirements for wheel sizes or crank lengths have changed.

#### Protests
The rules around protests have been updated. Specifically details around the timing of submitting and responding to a protest have been updated.

#### Wheel Walk Race
Consistent with Chapter 1, wheel walking can be done with one or both feet.

#### Starting
Clarification: The race begins at the _beginning_ of the starting tone.

#### Second Attempt After Hindrance or Interference
This rule has been substantially changed and rewritten. This is to give some guidelines to Referees as to what constitutes hindrance or interference.

Secondly, an option is added that not only the hindered rider, but also other riders from the same heat can drop their previous result and redo their heat.  In case of a whole-heat re-run, riders who opt to ride again must give up their previous result.

#### Finishes
Apart from a few edits for clarity, the essential changes are two-fold:
 
1. The judgement of "in control" is exercised when the front (as opposed to the rear) of the wheel crosses the finish line.  
2. "In control" in wheel walking is no longer defined as having one foot on the wheel, rather, the new criterion is that wheel walking is still occurring when crossing the finish.

## 3 Track: Other

#### Slow Races: Penalty Rules
The host can now choose to make the penalty rules optional. This is particularly relevant when using a reliable objective (i.e. digital) detection system.

#### Slow Races: Qualification and Final Rounds, and Age Group
The rules have been updated to allow for more flexibility in the setup of the competition rounds and age groups for non-Unicon events.

## 4 Road Racing

#### Wheel Sizes
The new unicycle class definitions have been applied to this chapter. The 700c class is now "29 Class" which allows a maximum wheel diameter of 778mm. This should allow the use of virtually any commercially available 28/29 inch tire and rim combination. As such, virtually any unicycle that conformed to the old 700c class will also work for 29 Class unicycles.

#### Heat Start: Top Male and Female Heats
The first and second heats should be devoted to the fastest males and females, respectively. The top males and the top females must have equivalent racing conditions. The time gaps between heats 1, 2, and 3 must now be designed such that heats have the least chance of interfering with the top male and female riders. This should prevent the chance of top males and females from drafting, benefiting psychologically and/or inhibiting each other.

## 5 Mountain Unicycling: Races

#### False Starts
Muni now has false start rules. They are very similar to the Road Racing rules. There are three options for false start rules:

1. Time Penalty (e.g. 10 seconds)
2. One False Start Allowed Per Rider
3. One False Start Allowed Per Heat

1\. is the default and recommended option.

#### Passing
Riders no longer have to maintain a full wheel diameter of distance between each other. However riders must pay attention while passing and avoid physical contact as much as possible.

#### Dismounts and Finishes: Uphill
Riders must ride the entire uphill course. If they dismount, they must remount at the location of the wheel at the moment of the dismount (or farther back). They must cross the finish line mounted, having both feet on the pedals. In the event of a dismount at the finish line the rider must back up, remount and ride across the finish line again.

#### Finishes: Cross Country and Downhill
Riders can cross the finish line mounted as well as walking. Any finish where the rider is not mounted on the unicycle, having both feet on the pedals, will be penalized by adding a 10 second penalty.

#### Course Requirements: Uphill
There are now minimum course requirements for an Uphill race at Unicon.

#### Course Requirements: Downhill
No changes.

#### Course Requirements: Cross Country
The minimum course requirements for Cross Country at Unicon have been updated. The required muni elite course should be 15-25km and last about 1 hour 30 minutes for the fastest riders.

#### Publishing Course Details
A GPS track of courses must be published at least one month prior to the competition.

#### Route Signaling
Specific rules about how and when courses must be marked have been added to the rulebook. There are three options for marking courses:

1. Painting or chalk marking
2. Using bands (barrier tape)
3. Any other clear signaling method

Marks must be made at intersections and after intersections on the wrong paths to inform riders of their mistake. Placing volunteers at key intersections is also highly recommended.

#### Practice
For all muni races, every rider must get the chance of at least one test run to get familiar with the track before the actual race. The race cannot be held without the possibility of practice.

#### Heat Start: Top Male and Female Heats
The first and second heats should be devoted to the fastest males and females, respectively. The top males and the top females must have equivalent racing conditions. The time gaps between heats 1, 2, and 3 must now be designed such that heats have the least chance of interfering with the top male and female riders. This should prevent the chance of top males and females from benefiting psychologically and/or inhibiting each other.

## 6 Mountain Unicycling: Cyclocross
#### Wheel Sizes
The new unicycle class definitions have been applied to this chapter. The 700c class is now "29 Class" which allows a maximum wheel diameter of 778mm. This should allow the use of virtually any commercially available 28/29 inch tire and rim combination. As such, virtually any unicycle that conformed to the old 700c class will also work for 29 Class unicycles.

#### Updated Classes
* Limited: Ungeared unicycles up to and including 29 Class wheels.
* Unlimited: Ungeared unicycles greater than 29 Class and geared unicycles.

#### Passing
In the case of a rider being lapped, the passing rider no longer has the right-of-way.

#### Finishes
Riders can now cross the finish line walking or running, as well as mounted.

#### Course Design
The course should be designed to avoid bottlenecks and give riders enough room to pass each other, especially after the start.

## 7 Artistic Freestyle
The IUF Freestyle Development Committee is still in session, thus the changes for this chapter are not final.

As of the latest update to this document (2017-03-09), the following changes have passed the Committee:

#### Time Limit for Jr. Small Group
Junior Small Group now has a time limit of 4 minutes compared to the normal Small Group time limit of 5 minutes.

#### Changing Routine Participants
As specificed in "Deadline For Signing Up", groups can now specify alternates and, in the case of injury or illness, the group may substitute riders up until the start of the routine. The Chief Judge must be notified of any changes or substitutions to be made.

#### Music and Media Types
Competitors must provide their music in a type that is supported, and has been announced by the Artistic Director. CDs are no longer required to be supported.

#### Minimum Judge Age
The minimum required age for judges is now 14 (instead of 15).

#### Acoustic Signals
The only acoustic signal made as part of a Freestyle performance will be at the end of the routine, if a routine exceed the time limit.

#### Dismount Judges for Group
At Unicon, at least four judges are required to count dismounts. Smaller events should have at least two dismount judges.

## 8 Freestyle: Standard Skill
No substantial rule changes were made.

## 9 Freestyle: X-Style
No substantial rule changes were made.

## 10 Flatland
Along with rule changes, the Flatland chapter underwent a large edit for content and clarity. Here is a summary of the important changes:

#### Last Trick in Prelims
A rider now only has two attempts to perform a last trick in the preliminary round. They still have three attempts during the battles.

#### Judging Combos
A rider should only be scored for a combo if it is completed successfully. A fall mid-combo no longer results in a partial score.

#### Updated Flatland Judging and Scoring Rules
Preliminary rounds and battles are judged using the following criteria.
The rider's total score is out of 40 points:

- **Difficulty** (0 to 10 points):  
Score is given for technical difficulty of the tricks and combos landed during the battle/preliminary.

- **Consistency** (0 to 10 points):  
Score is given for number of landed trick/combos on total of number of tricks/combos attempted during the battle/preliminary.

- **Variety** (0 to 10 points):  
Score is given for variation in the types of tricks done during the battle/preliminary.

- **Flow** (0 to 5 points):  
Score is given for cleanliness and style of rider during the battle/preliminary.

- **Last Trick** (0 to 5 points)

#### Advanced Category
The Advanced Category is now optional in general and not allowed at Unicon.

## 11 Street
Street and Flatland share many rules. Thus, many of the similar Street rules underwent a content edit identical to the Flatland chapter. No substantial rule changes were made.

## 12 Trials


#### Scoring

The course is divided in different sections of easy, medium and hard lines, worth different amounts of points.

| Difficulty | Points   |
|------------|----------|
| Easy       | 1 point  |
| Medium     | 3 points |
| Hard       | 7 points |

#### Finals with Few Competitors
If there are fewer than 6 competitors in the highest level category, no final is necessary. The results from the prelims will be taken as the final results and the top rider will be declared the champion.

## 13 Jumps

#### Number of Attempts
For prelims, the number of attempts for any one distance is now three. There is still the limit of 12 total attempts for prelims.

#### Long Jump on Platform Setup
The prescribed dimensions for the run-up and landing platforms have been made shorter to encourage a more "static" style of long jump.

#### Landing Surface for Platform High Jump
The landing surface for platform high jump has now been standardized to the size of a Euro pallet (120 * 80 cm) for all Platform High Jump comptetitions.

## 14 Hockey

In addition to a number of edits and clarifications, here is the summary of the most important changes made to the hockey chapter:

- The new unicycle class definitions have been applied to this chapter.
   Also, the allowable unicycle class for Hockey has been changed to 24+ Class unicycles.
   This means that the maximum outer diameter of the wheel is now 640 mm (24+ Class).
    This should allow the use of virtually any commercially available 24 inch tire and
    rim combination.

- When executing a free shot or a 6.5 m, the ball shall be hit with the
   stick, not dragged, flicked or lifted on the stick.

- A 6.5 m is awarded if an attacking player is fouled in the opposition
   goal area while in a strong position to score and is also awarded if an attacking
   player is fouled when moving towards the opposition goal with a single
   opponent in front.

- A 6.5 m awarded at the end of, or after a time period has ended, is
   still executed but play does not continue after an unsuccessful shot.

- Guidelines are now provided explaining when to send a player off the
   field for two minutes, five minutes or for the remainder of the game.

- If a team starts to play before the Referee’s whistle, the previous
   Referee ruling is repeated.

- High stick: The blade of the stick must always be below the players own hips and
   the hips of all players in the vicinity who might be endangered.

- If a referee is hit by the ball, the game is only interrupted if the
   contact has changed the course of play to benefit either team. In this
   case, the game is resumed with a face-off.

- New referee hand signs are included for "SUB and SIB", "obstacle" and
   "body contact".

## 15 Basketball
No substantial rule changes were made.

The new unicycle class definitions have been applied to this chapter. Specifically, allowable unicycles for Basketball are 24+ Class unicycles. However no requirements for wheel sizes or crank lengths have changed.
