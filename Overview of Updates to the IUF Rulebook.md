# Overview of Updates to the IUF Rulebook
This document wishes to serve as a simple overview of the changes that were passed in the 2016 IUF Rulebook Committee. These changes can be found in the 2017 IUF Rulebook (draft).

After publication of the 2017 rulebook, on the [IUF Publications webpage](https://unicycling.org/publications/) you will also be able to find a comprehensive, automatically generated PDF that contains all of the changes.

As always, as stated in *1B.3 Knowing The Rules*, you are obligated to know the updated IUF rules and reading this document does not serve as a replacement for reading the new rulebook. This document simply wishes to give a quick but thorough list of the differences.
